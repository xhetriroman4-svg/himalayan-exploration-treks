Task ID: deploy-himalayan-treks
Agent: Super Z (main)
Task: Clone https://github.com/xhetriroman4-svg/himalayan-exploration-treks and deploy it to the workspace

Work Log:
- Cloned the GitHub repo into /home/z/my-project/himalayan-exploration-treks/
- Identified project type: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma (SQLite)
- Moved all project files from the cloned subfolder to /home/z/my-project/ root (preserved existing download/ and tool-results/ folders)
- Deleted package-lock.json to allow fresh resolution
- Ran `npm install --no-audit --no-fund --loglevel=warn` (installed 585+ packages, ~1.1 GB)
- Verified `.env` correctly points DATABASE_URL to `file:/home/z/my-project/db/custom.db`
- Ran `npx prisma generate` to build the Prisma client
- Ran `npx prisma db push --skip-generate` to ensure DB schema is in sync (already in sync)
- Created `/home/z/my-project/scripts/start-dev.sh` to launch the dev server detached via setsid + nohup so it survives the launching shell
- Started the Next.js dev server on port 3000 (Next.js 16.2.9 with Turbopack, ready in ~250ms)
- Verified the deployment with curl: homepage returns HTTP 200 (144 KB), /api returns 200, /api/bookings returns existing bookings from SQLite
- Confirmed the homepage title: "Himalayan Exploration Treks | Adventure Travel Packages Nepal"

Stage Summary:
- Deployment is LIVE at https://preview-<bot-id>.space-z.ai/ (the gateway exposes port 3000 to the preview URL)
- The dev server is running detached (PID stored in /tmp/next-dev.pid; log at /tmp/next-dev.log)
- Restart script: `/home/z/my-project/scripts/start-dev.sh`
- Database is at `/home/z/my-project/db/custom.db` with the Booking model already containing seed data
- Tech stack: Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma 6 + SQLite
